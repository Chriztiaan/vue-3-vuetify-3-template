# vue-project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Dependencies

-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/es/blog/release/v18.12.0/)
-   [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) -> Note you only need to use Pnpm for installing (running/testing with npm is fine)

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) +
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run serve
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Technology Stack:

-   Vue 3 - SPA framework
    -   https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html
    -   The core library that the project revoles around, allows developers to create components and compose them.
-   Vite 4 - Blazing fast(TM) SPA builder tool
    -   https://vitejs.dev/guide/
    -   Provides the development server and building features, has really fast hot module reloading (HMR) which recompiles the project on saving code changes.
-   Typescript
    -   https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
    -   A typed superset language of Javascript
-   Vuetify 3 - Component library based on Material
    -   https://vuetifyjs.com/en/introduction/why-vuetify/
    -   A component library tailored for Vue, large catalogue of components with a great API
-   Pinia - State management library
    -   https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html
    -   State management allows you to store the application's data
    -   Serves as the foundation for the flux pattern, which is a recommended way for implementing data flow in a web application (https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview/)
-   Vue Router 4 - Routing library to nagivate between pages and provide url metadata
    -   https://router.vuejs.org/introduction.html
    -   Web apps often need more than one page, this is what you use for Vue
-   pnpm - Node package manager
    -   https://pnpm.io/installation
    -   It is recommended that developers use PNPM instead of NPM as it provides faster install times and a smaller `node_modules` directory
-   Vitest - Vite based testing library used for unit and component tests
    -   https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html
    -   Testing of logic and components is important, having HMR for your tests is also very convenient
-   Volar - IDE support for Vue in VS Code
    -   A minimal configuration is provided for Volar, and the code is Volar ready (AKA less Vue/TS problems like devs tended to have with Vue 2/Vetur)
-   Vue-tsc - Volar based command line typechecking for Vue
    -   https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/vue-tsc
    -   Any errors Volar is able to pickup, can be invoked via this command line tool. This is great as a git pre-commit hook or a type checking stage on in the CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins for example).
